# Unity project context

Updated September 7, 2026 for The Gatherer, the first Little Settlement step. See Docs/Validation.md for execution evidence and Docs/GathererPlaytest.md for the current playtest.

## Confirmed foundation

- Unity 6000.6.0f1, installed under Program Files/Unity/Hub/Editor. The project was migrated from its initial Unity 6000.3.12f1 baseline while still at the first prototype stage.
- Assets, Packages and ProjectSettings form a new project under this repository root.
- Universal 3D template foundation migrated to Unity 6.6. GraphicsSettings references its URP asset; QualitySettings preserves the template pipeline choices through Unity's serialized-settings upgrade.
- Input System enabled (`activeInputHandler: 1`); runtime owns one programmatic Gameplay action map.
- Package pins after the Unity 6.6 migration: AI Navigation 2.0.14, Input System 1.20.0, URP 17.6.0, Test Framework 1.8.0, uGUI 2.6.0, and Visual Studio integration 2.0.26. Unity 6.6 also added its required Physics Core 2D, TetGen, and Timeline Foundation modules. The resolved lockfile is authoritative after import. The original 6.3 setup required an Input System update from the template's incompatible 1.12.0 package; that historical issue remains resolved.
- No callable Unity MCP provider was exposed in this task. Local Unity batch execution is available.
- The repository was created for this project in the initial setup task.

## Code and ownership

All first-party runtime code is in Assets/_WonderGather/Scripts, namespace WonderGather, assembly WonderGather.Runtime. Unity.InputSystem, Unity.AI.Navigation and Unity.ugui are explicit assembly references.

RtsInput owns actions, including press/release/hold and Shift state. SelectionController owns the selection list and drag state, with an explicitly serialized roster for box selection. GroupMoveCommand plans spaced destinations and validates all paths before applying any. UnitMotor separates path planning from execution. MoveCommand still supports individual orders. RtsCamera focuses the selection center; SelectableUnit owns its ring. WandererHud draws the drag box, selected count, and order feedback.

Editor-only WonderGather.Editor contains scene creation, preview and Windows build entry points. Tests live in their own PlayMode test assembly. Gatherer owns a small work state machine and cargo; ResourceNode owns remaining supplies and ResourceDepot owns stored supplies. GatherCommand and ReturnSuppliesCommand enter through CommandDispatcher. No networking, save system or animation framework exists yet.

## Startup and assets

WandererSetup.Create creates the original TheWanderer scene, Wanderer prefab, materials and baked NavMesh. GroupSetup.Create copies that scene into TheGroup, places eight prefab instances, wires the selection roster, and configures high-quality NavMesh avoidance with varied priorities. It refuses to overwrite an existing Group scene. TheGroup is the first enabled build scene; TheWanderer remains enabled for regression tests. GroupSetup.BuildWindows builds only TheGroup into Builds/WindowsGroup. Layer 6 is Walkable and distinguishes commandable ground from obstacles and units. The camera world mask includes Default and Walkable.

For future runtime spawning, extend roster ownership explicitly; current box selection covers the scene's configured friendly units. Formations are destination grids, not rigid travel constraints. ReachableDestination searches triangle candidates by distance and validates complete routes, excluding disconnected islands. GroupMoveCommand adjusts overlapping projected slots with a bounded nearby search; orders that cannot fit still preserve previous destinations. Strict UnitMotor.TryPlanMove remains available for interactions that must actually reach their target.

Use private serialized fields, PascalCase types/methods, explicit dependency wiring and small components. New scene creation must not overwrite an existing scene. Preserve Unity-generated metadata and the package lock in Git.

## Validation and limits

Read Docs/Validation.md for final execution results. PlayMode tests cover routing around the obstacle wall, rejection of disconnected/out-of-range/nonfinite destinations, and selection disable lifecycle. Manual checks are in Docs/Playtest.md. Desktop mouse/keyboard and flat terrain are the current scope. Camera feel and art direction require user playtesting.

Source evidence: ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt, GraphicsSettings.asset, QualitySettings.asset, ProjectSettings.asset, Packages/manifest.json, first-party runtime/editor/test sources and recovered conversation text. The referenced PDF dossier was not available as file contents.

GathererSetup.Create copies TheGroup into TheGatherer, adds one finite supply node, one depot and eight worker components, and preserves the 0.005 zoom preference. It refuses to overwrite the scene. TheGatherer is first in build settings; previous scenes remain for regressions. GathererSetup.BuildWindows builds only TheGatherer into Builds/WindowsGatherer. Interaction offsets are serialized per worker and no runtime scene search is used. New materials are placeholders.
